# CLASSIFICATION-OF-BREAST-CANCER-ON-PREDICTION-OF-DIAGNOSIS
  Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women around the world, and it is on the rise in
  developing countries, where the majority of cases are discovered late. Any advancement in
  cancer illness prediction and detection is critical for a healthy life. As a result, high accuracy
  in cancer prediction is critical for keeping patient treatment and survivability standards up to
  date. Furthermore, accurate benign tumour classification can save patients money by
  preventing them from receiving unnecessary therapy. Machine learning approaches have the
  potential to make a significant contribution to breast cancer prediction and early detection.
  On the Breast cancer Wisconsin Diagnostic dataset, we used five machine learning
  algorithms: Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Logistic Regression, Sequential Classifier,
  K-Nearest Neighbours classifier (KNN), and Decision Tree algorithm. After obtaining the
  results, we performed a performance evaluation and comparison between these different
  classifiers. The researchers used multiple functions for this algorithm and included extra
  features such as bagging and boosting to strengthen its usefulness. The results showed that
  the Sequential classifier obtained high accuracy, around 99 percent.
